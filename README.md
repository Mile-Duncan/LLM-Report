# Indent-based programming syntax: is it better

Having recently been forced to learn Python, I wanted to know if there is any benefit to the strict indentation style syntax Python uses compared to more conventional languages that use braces to signify a block of code. Is it any easier or harder for people to read and type, and are there tradeoffs on the compiler level? Are there other reasons why this language was made in such a way?

## Relevant Concepts:

* [Programming Language Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages))
* [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
* [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#)

### Why do programming languages use different syntax? 

Programming languages use different methods to define code blocks (such as brackets or indentation) primarily due to design choices and philosophies that influence their syntax and readability.

* Brackets (e.g., C, Java, JavaScript) provide explicit visual delimiters for code blocks. This explicitness can aid in understanding complex nested structures. They also offer flexibility in code formatting, as indentation is not syntactically significant.
* Indentation (e.g., Python, Haskell) leverages whitespace to define code blocks, promoting consistent formatting and arguably enhancing code readability by visually representing the code's structure. This approach eliminates the need for explicit delimiters, reducing visual clutter.

The choice between these methods often reflects the language's design goals:

* Readability and maintainability: Python's use of indentation aims to enforce clean code layout and improve readability, especially for beginners.
* Flexibility: Bracket-based languages offer more freedom in code formatting, but this can lead to inconsistencies across projects.
* Historical context: Many older languages adopted brackets due to limitations in early parsing techniques or influences from prior languages.

It's important to note that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and the choice often boils down to personal preference and the specific needs of a project.

### What are the historical technical benefits of using brackets

**Facilitated Parsing:**

* Brackets offer a straightforward and predictable syntax for parsers to interpret.
* Their clear delimiters enable parsers to efficiently identify code blocks, leading to faster and more reliable compilation or interpretation.

**Enhanced Error Detection:** 

* Bracket-based syntax aids in early detection of structural errors during development.
* Mismatched or missing brackets are typically flagged by compilers or code editors, allowing prompt identification and correction of potential issues.

**Legacy Compatibility:** 

* Numerous established programming languages employ brackets, providing a familiar syntax for experienced developers and ensuring compatibility with extensive legacy codebases. 

**Tooling Integration:**

* Code editors and IDEs are well-equipped to handle bracket-based languages, offering features such as automatic bracket completion, matching, and highlighting.
* This streamlines development, improves productivity, and further contributes to error prevention.

### Is there any research that definitively found one syntax to be better than the other

While no single syntax is universally proven to be both the most user-friendly and efficient to run, some syntax features and paradigms have demonstrated benefits in those areas. When it comes to user-friendly aspects, readability, and minimal punctuation can make the language clearer. Conciseness and interface design also play a large role in decreasing the likelihood of errors. When making a programming language more efficient, compiled, static-typed languages with low-level control, such as C, C++, and Go, are recommended. Ultimately, the choice of syntax and language depends on the specific requirements of the project. Research in programming language design is ongoing, and new languages and paradigms are constantly emerging.
